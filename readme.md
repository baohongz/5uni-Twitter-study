Is Twitter an ascendant scholarly communication medium, or just an overhyped fad? We sought to answer this question by examining the Twitter use habits, if any, of 8,826 scholars from five diverse universities.

Data
----

We're not including the raw data with this project to protect the privacy of the people in our sample. We used only information from public Twitter profiles and public Web pages to compile the sample; however, it's important to consider people's expectations of privacy when aggregating data from multiple sources [1]. So although we generally prefer to share all research data, in this case we're erring on the side of caution.

This is the second study we've done on scholarly Tweeting. You can find a citation and link to fulltext of our first one, "How and why scholars cite on Twitter," in this [public Zotero library](https://www.zotero.org/groups/twitter_for_scholarship/items), along with a selection of similar studies by other folks.
